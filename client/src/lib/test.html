font-size-16-26 bias-excerpt-body c-mt-4 text-dark-green mb-14"><p>The<em> action bias</em> describes our tendency to favor action over inaction, often to our benefit. However, sometimes, we feel compelled to act, even if there’s no evidence that it will lead to a better outcome than doing nothing would. Our tendency to respond with action as a default, automatic reaction, even without solid rationale to support it, has been termed the action bias.</p><p class=" block-img"><img src="https://images.prismic.io/thedecisionlab/0ee9cc1d-1720-4bb2-9c66-aadc55f2314b_Action-Bias.jpeg?auto=compress,format" alt="an illustration titled &quot;Action Bias&quot; that shows three cartoon cars in a traffic jam. The driver in the first car, colored blue, is honking and thinking, &quot;Maybe if I beep more, they&#x27;ll go away...&quot; The other two cars behind are colored purple and have drivers looking ahead, not reacting. The illustration humorously depicts the concept of &quot;Action Bias,&quot; where people feel compelled to take action, even if it&#x27;s ineffective, in situations of stress or uncertainty."/></p></div></div><div><section class="inline-block "><div class="rich-text prose max-w-none content-section-title"><h2>Where this bias occurs</h2></div><div class="rich-text prose max-w-none"><p>Suppose you’re a soccer goalkeeper, preparing to block a penalty kick in the midst of the final playoff game. If you’re like most goalies, when attempting to stop a shot, you’ll jump either to the left or right nearly every time. Yet your chances of successfully blocking the kick are statistically greater if you simply stay still.<sup>1</sup></p><p>So what compels you to jump instead of standing your ground? It’s the action bias: our instinct that doing something is better than doing nothing. You may feel that people would judge your failure to make the save less harshly if you could prove that you made an attempt to stop it.
